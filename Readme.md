# birf Engine for Actionscript 3

A general game creation library based on a variant of the MVP design pattern. Inspired by modern frameworks such as: RobotLegs and PureMVC.

## F.A.Q.

### What is a birf?

It's a abbreviation of 'burn in righteous fire' which might seem very random. And it is. :) For a game developer, my imagination is somewhat limited when it comes to names.

### Why another framework?

Mostly as a learning experience, and because I can. :P I've always enjoyed rolling my own frameworks because you learn a lot from it. And this is basically the culmination of my 6+ years in the actionscript/flash scene. Other than that, if anyone else finds use for it that's great. :)
